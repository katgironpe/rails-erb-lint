    And the output should contain "A simple lint tool for ERB Rails views"

  Scenario: Wheck check_validity option is called on valid views without arguments
    Given I have only valid ERB files
    When I check validity of ERB files in current directory
    Then the output should contain "Checking for files in current directory"
    And the output should contain "1 files, no invalid file"
    And the exit status should be 0
