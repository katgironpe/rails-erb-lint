Checks for the validity of your ERB views.

## "But if you write tests, you won't have these problems"

So test. TDD is not dead.

## Requirements

* Ruby 1.9.3 or greater

## Installation

```bash
gem install rails-erb-lint
```

## Usage

```bash
cd your-rails-app/app/views
rails-erb-lint check
```

By default, we don't show which files are valid as that makes little sense. 
However you can show them through valid mode.

```bash
cd your-rails-app/app/views
rails-erb-lint check -v
```

## Using Slim and HAML

Initially planned to discontinue the idea of a lint tool for ERB views.
I think there should be a gem that works for Slim/HAML/ERB for that.

ERB by experience is not fun or sensible to use.
HAML or Slim works well.
